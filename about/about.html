<h1 class="center-align">About</h1>
<div class="row left-align">
  <h3>Concept</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>The main purpose of ASA Stats is to evaluate and present the current balance in Algos for any address on the Algorand blockchain. Such a balance is calculated by adding the existing ALGO balance and the estimated sum of values of all the ASAs account holds.<br>
    <br>
    The final phase of development for the inclusion of accounts' NFT values is expected to take place after the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decipher-tickets-170181821409" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="DeCipher event tickets">Decipher event</a>. That would probably coincide with the finished ASA Stats Token <a href="{% url 'tokenomics' %}"> presale phase</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In this first phase, users have to refresh an address page in order to receive the latest data. Real-time account tracking development is expected to take place either during or after the implementation of the NFT evaluation functionality.<br>
    <br>
    An automatic throttling/rate-limiting development will take place afterward, as one of the requirements for both business use and adoption of ASASTATS utility token.<br>
    <br></p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
  <div class="col s12">
    <p>The primary goal is to provide a great user experience. If that can be achieved, then establishment of project's DAO would become the very next primary goal.<br>
    <br>
    ASA Stats aims to have price information on every ASA and NFT that has ever been sold.<br>
    <br>
    For those that have never been sold, the price evaluation algorithms would be developed and if possible an informative price will be presented to the user together with the reasoning for such evaluation.<br>
    <br>
    ASA Stats will implement every publicly available SDK (preferably <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Python programming language website">Python</a>) of all major DEX solutions on the Algorand blockchain as soon as such SDK is available. Also, ASA Stats author (and ideally <a href="#involve">the team</a> too) will actively contribute to those SDK codebases during the pre-DAO ASA Stats phase. As of February 2022, <a href="https://www.tinyman.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Go to Tinyman website">Tinyman AMM</a>, respectively related <a href="https://github.com/tinymanorg/tinyman-py-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Tinyman Python SDK repository">py-tinyman-sdk</a> represents the only available SDK for any AMM/DEX on Algorand Mainnet.

    Various steps should be taken in order to achieve the goal of establishing a DAO. Some of those steps - like emphasizing an individual - at first glance may look like moving in the opposite direction. However, adding the following text to this page represents an act of transparency and it's just an honest step in everlasting focus at preventing a red-flag raising on ASA Stats:<br>
    <br>
    <em>Ivica started with professional programming during university by creating desktop software for financial and inventory accounting. In the years that followed, he designed and created various desktop software for multiple purposes and clients. He specialized in accounting software for a wide variety of businesses, including cafes, bars, shops and exchange offices, as well as bus and boat traveling tickets systems. His first web programming projects in 2000 coincided with his first time working in a team. He was hired by an IT company for the job of designing and developing applications in ASP/VBScript.<br>
    After a few years, Ivica completely switched to Python and since then has developed desktop software with related Python wrappers for GTK, Qt, wxWindows/wxWidgets, and Tkinter, and has developed web applications in Django. Recently, Ivica has been focused on mastering new technologies, like unit and functional testing, NoSQL, continuous management and deployment, GNU/Linux system administration, system security, etc. Since changing his development process to test-driven development, Ivica has developed and released a long-planned project, the <a href="https://hopemeet.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit Hopemeet match engine">Hopemeet match engine</a>, and have developed <a href="https://github.com/ipaleka/arrangeit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="arrangeit Github repository">arrangeit</a> - the open-source and cross-platform successor of his own shareware created in the Nineties.<br>
    For the last year Ivica has familiarized himself with the Algorand blockchain. He created and now maintains <a href="https://github.com/ipaleka/algorand-provisioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit GitHub repo">the repository</a> with an Ansible script for provisioning the Algorand Node on all the popular contemporary operating systems. He has been an active community member in official Algorand channels such as theAlgorand Discord, GitHub, forum, and subreddit, as well as being involved in creating publications and related public code repositories for the Algorand developer portal (<a href="https://developer.algorand.org/solutions/getting-started-with-python-algorand-sdk-and-django/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit Algodjango solution on Algorand developer portal">Getting started with Python Algorand SDK and Django</a> and <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/create-and-test-smart-contracts-using-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit Python testing tutorial on Algorand developer portal">Create and test smart contracts using Python</a>)</em>.
